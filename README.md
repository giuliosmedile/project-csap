# project-csap
Project for A.Y. 2020/2021 for the course of Computer Systems and Programming @ Sapienza held by Prof. Giorgio Richelli.

# Installation
Use `make all` to compile all programs.
The executables will be found as 	`main` in the directories `client`, `server` and `datarepo`.

Alternatively, each program can be made indipendently, by calling its name.

# Usage
By default, `server` will run on localhost on port 16000, `datarepo` on 16001.

Client will attempt to connect to those ports and addresses.
These properties can be changed by modifying the `.config` file of each program.
